                <p>Forthcoming in Fall 2023 with Cambridge University Press, <i>The Networked Leviathan: For Democratic Platforms</i> gives a case for building bottom-up participatory governance institutions into large internet platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It does so through an argument rooted in the insights of generations of political scientists about the problems with information and self-control that political states experience, paired with an account of how large platform companies face similar problems. Democratizing the platforms on a global basis has the potential to help protect the world against the numerous ills that uncontrolled online misconduct has inflicted on the world---such as fraud, misinformation, and election disruption---while also potentially mitigating the neocolonial relationship that American companies currently have with the Global South.</p>
                <p>The Networked Leviathan is available for pre-order in paper and cloth. When it is released (approximately September/October 2023), it will also be available for free in open-access e-book format.</p>

                <p>Published in 2021 by Hart, <i>The Rule of Law in the United States: An Unfinished Project of Black Liberation</i> gives an account of the peculiarly American instantiation of the rule of law. It focuses on explicating the ideals of the American rule of law by asking: how do we interpret its history and the goals of its constitutional framers to see the rule of law ambitions its foundational institutions express? It also considers those constitutional institutions as inextricable from the problem of race in the United States and the tensions between the rule of law as a protector of property rights and the rule of law as a restrictor on arbitrary power and a guarantor of legal equality. In that context, it explores the distinctive role of Black liberation movements in developing the American rule of law</p>

                <p>Published in 2016 by Cambridge University Press, <i>The Rule of Law in the Real World</i> gives a comprehensive theory of the political and legal ideal known as "the rule of law" which draws on both normative theory from political philosophy and strategic analysis from political science. The rule of law should be understood as the coordinated collective control of power, and matters because it constitutes a morally important kind of social equality. The book develops a case for how those properties should be taken into account in social scientific attempts to measure the rule of law as well as policy efforts to promote it.</p>
